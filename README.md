## About Me

Applied Deep Learning engineer specializing in **Computer Vision for medical imaging**, designing AI systems that drive clinical efficiency, reduce operational friction, and support data-driven decision-making for healthcare providers and industry stakeholders.

🦷 At **[Pearl AI](https://www.hellopearl.com/)**, I contribute to the development and scaling of production-grade diagnostic models and inference platforms deployed across real-world dental practices. My work focuses on improving model reliability, streamlining integration, and delivering AI solutions that generate measurable clinical and operational value at scale.

📚 In parallel, I **teach Deep Learning and Computer Vision**, with a strong emphasis on applied methodologies, real-world deployment constraints, and the translation of research outcomes into production-ready solutions.
